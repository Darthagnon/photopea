# Photopea Offline

## Why I made this
The creator of [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/), a great free alternative to Photoshop, is not interested on making an offline version, so I took it upon myself to make it.

## Issues
If there are any issues, please let me know.

## How to use
1. Download the repository
2. Open a terminal
3. `cd` into the folder where you downloaded it
4. In the folder, type this: `python -m http.server --directory www.photopea.com 8080`
5. Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). It should load and you can use it like normal.

## Notes
If you want to download the fonts, just append `--fonts` to the Updater.py file.
